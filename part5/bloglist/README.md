## Testing in the Front End

In this part of the course I have learned to do tests on the client, unit tests with JEST, these tests are done at the component level to validate that they properly render the content and validate that the pros are used as they should be.

I also learned how to do e2e (End to End) tests with Cypress, these tests are more complex since they are done at the user level, this means that the application is tested in a browser as if a user interacted with the page.
